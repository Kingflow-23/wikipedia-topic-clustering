# wikipedia-topic-classifier
This project scrapes Wikipedia pages on various topics, processes the text using TF-IDF vectorization, and clusters the topics using KMeans. The results are visualized in a 2D plot using UMAP, providing insights into the relationships and groupings of different Wikipedia topics based on their content.
