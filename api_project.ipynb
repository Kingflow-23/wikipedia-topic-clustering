define processes and general principles in music the musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis in that it takes as its startingpoint not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is builtmusic theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics because of the everexpanding conception of what constitutes music a more inclusive definition could be the consideration of any sonic phenomena including silence this is not an absolute guideline however for example the study of music in the quadrivium liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice but this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries and is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of

impossible as the majority of early musical instruments were constructed of animal skins bone wood and other nondurable biodegradable materials additionally some have proposed that lithophones or stones used to make musical soundslike those found at sankarjang in indiaare examples of prehistoric musical instrumentsmusical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the

       "dict_values(['an electric car or electric vehicle ev is a passenger automobile that is propelled by an electric traction motor using electrical energy as the primary source of propulsion the term normally refers to a plugin electric vehicle typically a battery electric vehicle bev which only uses energy stored in onboard battery packs but broadly may also include plugin hybrid electric vehicle phev rangeextended electric vehicle reev and fuel cell electric vehicle fcev which can convert electric power from other fuels via a generator or a fuel cellcompared to conventional internal combustion engine ice vehicles electric cars are quieter more responsive have superior energy conversion efficiency and no exhaust emissions as well as a lower overall carbon footprint from manufacturing to end of life even when a power plant supplying the electricity might add to its emissions due to the superior efficiency of electric motors electric cars also generate less waste heat thus reducing the need for engine cooling systems that are often large complicated and maintenanceprone in ice vehiclesthe electric vehicle battery typically needs to be plugged into a mains electricity power supply for recharging in order to maximize the cruising range recharging an electric car can be done at different kinds of charging stations these charging stations can be installed in private homes parking garages and public areas there is also research and development in as well as deployment of other technologies such as battery swapping and inductive charging as the recharging infrastructure especially fast chargers is still in its infancy range anxiety and time cost are frequent psychological obstacles during consumer purchasing decisions against electric carsworldwide  million plugin electric cars were sold in   of new car sales up from  in  many countries have established government incentives for plugin electric vehicles tax credits subsidies and other nonmonetary incentives while several countries have legislated to phaseout sales of fossil fuel cars to reduce air pollution and limit climate change evs are expected to account for over onefifth of global car sales in china currently has the largest stock of electric vehicles in the world with cumulative sales of  million units through december  although these figures also include heavyduty commercial vehicles such as buses garbage trucks and sanitation vehicles and only accounts for vehicles manufactured in china in the united states and the european union as of  the total cost of ownership of recent electric vehicles is cheaper than that of equivalent ice cars due to lower fueling and maintenance costsin  the tesla model y became the worlds best selling car the tesla

the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the internet protocol suite tcpip to communicate between networks and devices it is a network of networks that consists of private public academic business and government networks of local to global scope linked by a broad array of electronic wireless and optical networking technologies the internet carries a vast range of information resources and services such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the world wide web www electronic mail internet telephony and file sharingthe origins of the internet date back to research that enabled the timesharing of computer resources the development of packet switching in the s and the design of computer networks for data communication the set of rules communication protocols to enable internetworking on the internet arose from research and development commissioned in the s by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa of the united states department of defense in collaboration with universities and researchers across the united states and in the united kingdom and france the arpanet initially served as a backbone for the interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the united states to enable resource sharing the funding of the national science foundation network as a new backbone in the s as well as private funding for other commercial extensions encouraged worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies and the merger of many networks using darpas internet protocol suite the linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early s as well as the advent of the world wide web marked the beginning of the transition to the modern internet and generated sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional personal and mobile computers were connected to the internetwork although the internet was widely used by academia in the s the subsequent commercialization of the internet in the s and beyond incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern lifemost traditional communication media including telephone radio television paper mail and newspapers are reshaped redefined or even bypassed by the internet giving birth to new services such as email internet telephone internet radio internet television online music digital newspapers and audio and video streaming websites newspapers books and other print publishing have adapted to website technology or have been reshaped into blogging web feeds and

political economic personal and social equality of the sexes feminism holds the position that modern societies are patriarchalthey prioritize the male point of viewand that women are treated unjustly in these societies efforts to change this include fighting against gender stereotypes and improving educational professional and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for womenoriginating in late thcentury europe feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for womens rights including the right to vote run for public office work earn equal pay own property receive education enter into contracts have equal rights within marriage and maternity leave feminists have also worked to ensure access to contraception legal abortions and social integration and to protect women and girls from sexual assault sexual harassment and domestic violence changes in female dress standards and acceptable physical activities for women have also been part of feminist movementsmany scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for womens rights particularly in the west where they are nearuniversally credited with achieving womens suffrage genderneutral language reproductive rights for women including access to contraceptives and abortion and the right to enter into contracts and own property although feminist advocacy is and has been mainly focused on womens rights some argue for the inclusion of mens liberation within its aims because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles feminist theory which emerged from feminist movements aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining womens social roles and lived experiences feminist theorists have developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gendernumerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years representing different viewpoints and political aims traditionally since the th century firstwave liberal feminism which sought political and legal equality through reforms within a liberal democratic framework was contrasted with labourbased proletarian womens movements that over time developed into socialist and marxist feminism based on class struggle theory since the s both of these traditions are also contrasted with the radical feminism that arose from the radical wing of secondwave feminism and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate patriarchy liberal socialist and radical feminism are sometimes referred to as the big three schools of feminist thoughtsince the late th century many newer forms of feminism have emerged some forms such as white feminism and gendercritical feminism have been criticized as taking into account only white middle class collegeeducated heterosexual or cisgender perspectives these criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism such as black feminism and intersectional feminism', 'cyberbullying cyberharassment or online bullying is a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means since the s it has become increasingly common

intensity duration and frequency of bullying are three aspects that increase the negative effects on both of them', 'presentday climate change includes both global warmingthe ongoing increase in global average temperatureand its wider effects on earths climate system climate change in a broader sense also includes previous longterm changes to earths climate the current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities especially fossil fuel burning since the industrial revolution fossil fuel use deforestation and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases these gases absorb some of the heat that the earth radiates after it warms from sunlight warming the lower atmosphere carbon dioxide the primary gas driving global warming has increased in concentration by about  since the preindustrial era to levels not seen for millions of yearsclimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment deserts are expanding while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common amplified warming in the arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms droughts and other weather extremes rapid environmental change in mountains coral reefs and the arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful some effects will continue for centuries these include ocean heating ocean acidification and sea level riseclimate change threatens people with increased flooding extreme heat increased food and water scarcity more disease and economic loss human migration and conflict can also be a result the world health organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the st century societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or droughtresistant crops partially reduces climate change risks although some limits to adaptation have already been reached poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate changemany climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the st century with  the warmest on record at  c  f since regular tracking began in  additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points such as melting all of the greenland ice sheet under the  paris agreement nations collectively agreed to keep warming well under  c however with pledges made under the agreement global warming would still reach about  c  f by the end of the century limiting warming to  c would require halving emissions by  and achieving netzero emissions by fossil fuel use can be phased out by conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution these energy sources include wind solar hydro and nuclear power cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation heating buildings and running industrial processes carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil', 'vikings were seafaring people originally from scandinavia presentday denmark norway and sweden who from the late th to the late th centuries raided pirated traded and settled throughout parts of europe they also voyaged as far as the

civilisation of the norsemen that emerges from archaeology and historical sources a romanticised picture of vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the th century this developed and became widely propagated during the thcentury viking revival perceived views of the vikings as violent piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern viking myth that had taken shape by the early th century current popular representations of the vikings are typically based on cultural clichs and stereotypes complicating modern appreciation of the viking legacy these representations are rarely accuratefor example there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets a costume element that first appeared in the th century', 'napoleon bonaparte born napoleone

more than  lung involvement on imaging and  develop critical symptoms respiratory failure shock or multiorgan dysfunction older people have a higher risk of developing severe symptoms some complications result in death some people continue to experience a range of effects long covid for months or years after infection and damage to organs has been observed multiyear studies on the longterm effects are ongoingcovid transmission occurs when infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes nose or mouth the risk is highest when people are in close proximity but small airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances particularly indoors transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus people remain contagious for up to  days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptomstesting methods for covid to detect the viruss nucleic acid include realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr transcriptionmediated amplification and reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal
